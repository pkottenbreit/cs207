## Project Overview

### Our Objective
Our objective is to produce an input device to control flight simulation video games.

### Acknoledgements
This project is based on the ["Sim Racing Button Box" project by Hobbylex on instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/Sim-Racing-Button-Box/)

### Our Modification
Because flight controls (implemented as switched) need to be left on, we modified the design to no longer require a matrix. We designed 3 different ways to accomplish our objective and modification, each with their own drawbacks.

### Our Motivation
Braden has been playing Flight Simulator X, DCS World, and MSFS 2020 with his cousin.
